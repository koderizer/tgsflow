# TGSFlow

**Thought-Guided Software development workflow for human-AI collaboration**

TGSFlow enables structured, thoughtful software development through an approval-gated workflow where humans maintain strategic thinking while AI handles implementation. Perfect for use with Claude Code or any other AI coding agent or interactive vibe code in Cursor or any other IDE. 

## Quick Start 🚀 

Bootstrap a new project or apply on top of any existing project with TGSFlow in seconds:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akelv/tgsflow/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

What this does (safe, idempotent — re-run any time, add `--force` to upgrade):
- Downloads the TGS scaffold from this repo and copies it into the current directory.
- Writes the modern Claude Code setup: `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/commands/` (slash commands `/tgs-research`, `/tgs-plan`, `/tgs-close`), `.claude/hooks.json`.
- Writes the TGS tree under `tgs/`:
  - `tgs/design/` — long-lived system design docs (context, needs, architecture, V&V).
  - `tgs/agentops/` — workflow guide (`AGENTOPS.md`), thought templates, and prompts.
  - `tgs/adapters/` — shell adapters for Claude and Gemini CLIs.
  - `tgs/thoughts/` — per-thought dirs created by `make new-thought` (never overwritten by `--force`).
- Adds `Makefile.tgs.mk` and ensures the root `Makefile` includes it, so `make new-thought` works immediately.

## Install the tiny invisible tgs cli to improve thought quality (WIP)

- Homebrew (macOS/Linux):

```bash
brew tap akelv/tgs
brew install tgs
```

- Curl installer (portable):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akelv/tgsflow/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Once installed:

```bash
tgs help
```

## 5-minute Quickstart: Idea → PR

1) Create a thought (scaffolds docs under `tgs/thoughts/`):
```bash
make new-thought title="<short title>" spec="<one-line spec>"
```

2) Pack context into an AI brief for your agent:
```bash
tgs context pack "<your goal>"
# Opens/updates <thought>/aibrief.md with the most relevant design/context
```

3) Feed the brief to the AI agent of your choice to research, plan then get your approval before implementation.


## The full TGS Workflow

**TGS (Thought-Guided Software)** is an approval-gated workflow that ensures thoughtful development:

1. **Research** → Document problem, constraints, alternatives
2. **Plan** → Define implementation strategy and acceptance criteria  
3. **Human Approval** → Review and approve research + plan
4. **Implement** → Execute the approved plan
5. **Document** → Summarize what was built and how to use it

### Key Principles

- **Human thinks, AI implements** - Strategic decisions require human approval
- **Traceable thoughts** - Every change links to its research and planning
- **Approval gates** - No implementation without explicit human approval
- **Documentation-driven** - Clear records of why and how decisions were made

TGS aims at helping both small team and big organization with team of teams to apply spec driven developement with heavy use of AI code agent to solve aspect related to guardrails, quality gate approvals, audit trail for enterprise level.


### Enhanced structure spec driven development: 

Our fundamental belief is that creating software with AI for human must requires structured, precise language and rigorous verification and validation to ensure that system behaviors are well-tracked, testable, and always traceable back to the original thought's intent. This ensure software continue to be safe for human use. 

To achieve this, our project adopt foundations from the world of systems engineering: **INCOSE** guidelines and the **EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)** method.

- INCOSE provides the discipline of writing well-formed needs and requirements that are clear, measurable, and verifiable, ensuring sets of requirements are consistent and complete across the system lifecycle. For more, see the [INCOSE Guide to Writing Requirements](https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/working-groups/requirements-wg/gtwr/incose_rwg_gtwr_v4_040423_final_drafts.pdf).

- EARS complements this by offering simple yet powerful patterns for expressing requirements in unambiguous, structured natural language. You can review the [EARS resource by Alistair Mavin](https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/working-groups/requirements-wg/rwg_iw2022/mav_ears_incoserwg_jan22.pdf).

These approaches were shaped in mission-critical domains like aircraft engines, environments where safety at scale, traceability, and team-wide alignment are non-negotiable. 

By bringing them into our AI-driven software development, we treat our work with the same level of care: authoring systems where **precision**, **accountability**, and **human trust** are built in from the very start.

## Using with AI Code Assistants

### Claude Code / Cursor Integration

1. Copy the system prompt from `tgs/agentops/AGENTOPS.md`
2. Use it as your AI assistant's system prompt (CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md) 
3. The AI will automatically follow the TGS workflow

### Manual TGS Setup

Create a new thought for any feature or change:

```bash
make new-thought title="Add user authentication" spec="A requirement specification" 
```

This creates a structured directory with templates for research, planning, and implementation documentation.

## Project Templates

Simple bootstrap project to bootstrap new project available in `templates/`:
- [React](./templates/react/) - Modern React application with TypeScript
- [Python](./templates/python/) - Python project with modern packaging  
- [Go](./templates/go/) - Go application with standard structure
- [CLI](./templates/cli/) - Cross-platform CLI tool template

## Four Pillars of Human-Craft in AI-Native Development

TGSFlow is built on four principles for preserving human value while leveraging AI productivity:

**1. Judgment Amplification** — Humans decide *what* and *why*; AI handles *how*. TGS approval gates ensure human strategic thinking drives every change. The [Judgment Journal](./templates/judgment-journal.md) captures decision reasoning that no AI can replicate.

**2. Perspective Multiplexing** — Every research phase includes multi-stakeholder analysis (end-user, security, privacy, ops, future-debt) and an ethics quick-check. This ensures AI doesn't optimize for a single dimension.

**3. Compounding Institutional Knowledge** — Corrections become persistent rules (`.claude/rules/`). Decisions are captured in the judgment journal. Design docs evolve with the system. Knowledge compounds across sessions, not resets.

**4. Ethical Guardrails as First-Class Citizens** — Privacy, accessibility, and safety are structural requirements in templates, not afterthoughts. Human Craft Zones designate critical paths (auth, crypto, payments) that require human authorship.

## Why TGSFlow?

- **Ensure transparent intention** from every thought to working software
- **Reduces AI hallucination** through structured planning
- **Maintains human oversight** on important decisions
- **Creates audit trail** for all development decisions
- **Scales with team size** - clear handoff points
- **Framework agnostic** - works with any technology stack
- **Modular rules** — `.claude/rules/` with path-scoped, rationale-bearing rules
- **TGS Skills** — `/tgs-research`, `/tgs-plan`, `/tgs-close` load on-demand
- **Perspectives + Ethics** — built into research.md template
- **Self-improvement loop** — corrections compound into permanent rules

## Contributing

TGSFlow follows its own methodology. To contribute:

1. Create a thought: `make new-thought`
2. Complete research and planning phases
3. Get approval before implementation
4. Submit PR with complete thoughts documentation in **tgs/**

### EARS Linter grammar update

Generate the ANTLR Go parser for `src/core/ears/ears.g4` (requires Java and ANTLR):

```bash
brew install openjdk antlr
export CLASSPATH="$(brew --prefix)/libexec/antlr-4.13.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH"
make ears-gen
```

Enable in `tgs/tgs.yml`:

```yaml
guardrails:
  ears:
    enable: true
    require_shall: false
    paths:
      - tgs/design/10_needs.md
      - tgs/design/20_requirements.md
```

Run verify (EARS design-doc lints):

```bash
./bin/tgs verify ears --repo . --ci
```
